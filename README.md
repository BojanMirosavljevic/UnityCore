# UnityCore
Project core for blank projects in Unity

Download Unity package from https://github.com/BojanMirosavljevic/UnityCore/tree/main/ExportPackage and run it in your blank project to get ready for new prototypes or games.

NOTE: Don't forget to add Newtonsoft (recommended way to do it: Package Manager => + => "Add package from git URL..." => enter "com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json").
